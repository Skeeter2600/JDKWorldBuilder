# JDK World Builder

Welcome to JDK World Builder! This application is intended to be used as a source to organize, sort
and  distribute information related to any setting, whether it be a D&D campaign or any other work.
It runs on Java for its backend and uses JavaFX for the UI

## Future Plans
After the completion of the intial project, the plans are to implement the system such that it would
be able to be run online and to ether create a HTML based view or leave it as the JavaFX view. In addition,
the plans are to develop a database for the information so any updates to the information from the world
owner's end can be automatically updated for all users without needing to send an updated .bck file.
